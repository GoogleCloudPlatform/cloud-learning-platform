            "text": "\nResearch is a hallmark of higher education. In the 19th century, research became an integral part of the university ethos. In the United States specif- ically, that role assumed a pragmatic function as \u201cAmerican reformers fur- ther transformed higher education by stressing the relationship between the university and society through the concept of service and direct links with industry and agriculture\u201d (Altbach, 2011, p. 17). Earlier models of high- er education included significant focus on research. As higher education evolved, and particularly in the United States, where a more pragmatic ap- proach to higher education was realized, it became apparent that higher education needed to be more directly connected with the needs of society. For example, these needs included teaching and research in industry and agriculture. Even today, there is an apparent worldwide shift in focus to employment and employability training, which has opened new paths to professional doctorate degrees oriented toward scholar-practitioners who value the application of theory and research to practical problems. Thus, the role of research, and science, continues to be an important part of higher education at the doctoral level.\nScience has played a significant role as a means of generating new knowl-edge. Historians of science can trace the origins of a scientific method to the time of Aristotle and earlier. Aristotle was probably one of the first who formalized an approach to knowledge generation that involved a process of inquiry and analysis in which general principles can be formulated from what is observed (induction), and from these general principles, hypotheses can be derived that can be used to test those principles (deduction). The results of the tests of the hypotheses can then be used to inform theory. The cycle of induction and deduction is what is responsible for the creation of new knowledge (Gauch, 2003). In the 18th and 19th centuries, rationalism, defined as the belief that knowledge can be created through internal reflec- tion and logic, was superseded by empiricism, the belief that what is known is that which is discoverable by the senses and ultimately measurable. It is empiricism that has dominated contemporary scientific research.\nThe scientific method has provided a powerful approach toward knowl-edge generation and dissemination. The scientific method has led to the discoveries that have revolutionized technology and the ways we use it, \nour understanding of the nature of the universe, and the eradication of diseases. These discoveries are based on what can be directly seen in the microscope and the telescope and what can be measured and strict- ly controlled. Those discoveries came from the natural sciences, such as chemistry and biology, colloquially referenced as the hard sciences . In the social or soft sciences , by comparison, applying typical scientific standards is more challenging. For example, in the social sciences, it is difficult to isolate one factor that is suspected to cause a certain kind of behavior and measure its impact. People behave in expected and unex- pected ways that may change in different contexts and times. This vari- ation creates a major challenge in trying to explain and predict human behavior. Scientists try to isolate behavior and devise research studies to understand the effects of that behavior; the results are then interpreted by scientists and reviewed by the wider community of scientists as well as the public. Despite measures to isolate variables and validate survey instruments and assessments and thus bring objectivity into the process of discovery, interpreting human behavior is ultimately subjective and raises questions about what we can truly know and understand about behavior. It also raises questions about scientific interpretations of those behaviors. Therefore, it is not surprising that people have varying levels of confidence in the scientific enterprise as well as its explanations based on research.\nFunk and Rainie (2015) compared the beliefs of scientists from the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science and those from a random sample of the American public and found some encouraging re- sults: Overall, 79% of the adults reported that science has made life easier for most people, and 71% felt that investments in science have paid off in the long run. However, other findings provide a more nuanced examination of attitudes toward science. For example, 88% of scientists believed that it is safe to eat genetically modified foods, whereas only 37% of the adults sur- veyed believed they are safe. The same, but smaller, differences were found with evolution: Overall, 98% of scientists versus 65% of adults believed that humans have evolved over time. With vaccines, 86% of scientists versus 68% of adults believed that vaccination of children should be required. With climate change, 87% of scientists versus 50% of the public believed it was due to human activity. Compare this with the finding that the public believes that only 57% of scientists agree that climate change has been caused by humans. The differences reflected here are quite significant and suggest a public misperception of what scientists have come to understand through research. Additionally, Pew researchers found that perceptions of science and its contribution to society have decreased among scientists and the American public, both down by about 11 points. This report shows that in many ways, the perceptions of the role of science are decreasing over time, and on some key issues, significant differences in belief exist between sci- entists and the nonscience public over the role of science in understanding those issues.\nGiven the rich historical origins of scientific research, the important \nrole that research plays in society, and the views of the value of scientific research that often differ between scientists and the public, it is important for new social science researchers to be well grounded in the science that \nunderlies their specific disciplines as well as to understand the strengths and limitations of scientific research. Due to the changing landscape of so- cial science research, it is important for you to understand the foundations and language of research as well as its methods. With this understanding, you can enter confidently and knowledgably into the dialogues that charac- terize scholarship in the disciplines, in the debates that occur over what is scientific truth , and be prepared to engage in ethically and socially respon- sible research.\nThe purpose of this first chapter is to provide an overview of essential \nterminology of research. The language of research is found in many of the research texts you will read as well as the hundreds of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed research manuscripts you will examine as part of the process of learning the state of scholarship in your discipline, so under- standing the language will help you to become a better producer of as well as a critical consumer of research. Many authors use terminology related to research differently and, in some cases, incorrectly. The goal is not to take a position on whether individual definitions are correct or incorrect; rather, I will define the terminology used in this text to help provide clarity in how terms are used in order to minimize confusion.\nThe chapter begins with an introduction to research approaches (quali-tative, quantitative, and mixed methods) as well as distinctions among re- search approach, design, and methodology. Each of these will be carefully defined to ensure that there is no confusion during the reading of this text. Finally, the chapter ends with an overview of a description of the key phases of research, the components of which are described in various chapters throughout this text.",

            "text": "\nScience is a social field of forces, struggles, and relationships that is defined at every moment by the relations of power among the protagonists. Scientific choices are guided by taken-for-granted assumptions, interactive with prac- tices, as to what constitutes real and important problems, valid methods, and authentic knowledge. (Bourdieu, 1991, p. 3)\nBourdieu\u2019s writing underscores that science is a quintessentially social \nendeavor. Kuhn (2012) also referred to science as a social enterprise. Like any social group, social scientists have developed ways of speaking about how they engage with research. Given that multiple disciplines exist, each with varying perspectives on reality and differences in interpretation of which problems are important, it is not surprising to learn that each dis- cipline has language and practices specific to its own unique perspec- tives. Methods that guide research in anthropology, for example, may be different from those that guide research in public health; experimental designs may be a more important standard in some disciplines than oth- ers. Thus, not all scientists necessarily adopt the same terminology or ways of conducting research. What I focus on in this chapter are some basic definitions of terms that are common across disciplines to estab- lish a common language used in this text. The first important concept is scientific method .",
