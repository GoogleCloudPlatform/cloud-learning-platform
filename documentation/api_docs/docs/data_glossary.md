# Data Glossary

### Learning Distribution Channel

- The branded delivery channel where learning is offered via a product catalog

### Product Catalog

- Productized and published Learning Paths intended to meet the needs of Learners seeking any of the learning goal classifications, being Workforce, Credential, and Skill

### Learning Path (=Pathway)

- A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Learning Experiences required to achieve a Learning Goal

- Tagged with Skills / Competencies

- Sometimes also referred to as a Pathway, Program, or Curriculum

### Learning Experience

- A sequence of one or more Learning Objects associated an additional set of Summative assessments

- The associated Skills are 1) author tagged Competencies or Skills 2) the aggregate set of Skills from the Learning Objects and Assessment

- A Learning Experience can be stored in the Academic Catalog, and has associated Academic Credit

### Learning Object

- A sequence of one or more Learning Resources and Formative Assessment

- Tagged with Skills

### Learning Resource

- A non-interactive media item used for learning: text + images, video, audio

- Includes a link to the content object

- Tagged with Skills

### Assessment

- Associated with a Rubric

- Tagged with Skills

### Assessment Item

- Tagged with a Skill

### Formative Assessment

- Formative assessments tend to be about practicing the skills/performances of the summative assessment. The summative is about demonstrating mastery of the competency. Whether or not the assessments contribute to the grade have more to do with the learning model/modality, and not so much the type of assessment.

### Summative Assessment

- An assessment that is typically a more formal assessment that evaluates student learning at the end of an instructional unit. Whether or not the assessments contribute to the grade have more to do with the learning model/modality, and not so much the type of assessment.

### Mastery Spec: 
Specifies the criteria for mastering a Competency

- One or more Rubrics, with associated score thresholds.

### Learner Assessment

- An Assessment attempt by a Learner, consists of Learner Responses

### Learner Response

- An answered or completed assessment item

### Assessment Evaluation

- An evaluation of a rubric, for a Learner Assessment

### Rubric

- Scoring tool used to evaluate performance expectations in an assessment

### Rubric Criterion

- These are the individual "rows" or criteria described within the rubric. Tracking these individual items allows for more granular analytics around the specific aspects of competencies/skills students might be struggling with. It also allows for a form of item analysis for project-based assessments

### Learner Engagement Event

- Record of activity associated with the learnerâ€™s engagement with the learning ecosystem

- Can include LMS activity (learning resource usage), CRM

### Learning Objective (mostly equivalent to Learning Outcome)

- Learning objectives are statements that describe the knowledge or skills Learners should acquire by the end of a particular assignment, class, course, or program, and help Learners understand why that knowledge and those skills will be useful to them. They focus on the context and potential applications of knowledge and skills, help Learners connect learning in various contexts, and help guide assessment and evaluation.

### Learning Goal

Three types:

- Workforce - Career/Job/Role

- Credential - Degree/Certificate/Badges

- Skill/Competency

### Competency

- Collection of skills that would generally be associated with a single credit

- Can be credit bearing or non-credit bearing

### Skill

- A skill is the learned ability to perform an action with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both.

### Skill Graph

- Contains Skill nodes

### Academic Credentials

- We will use the credential data model of CTDL as the baseline for our model, and extend this where needed to account for unique Academic Program needs (e.g. Baymax specific credential needs).

- The only common instance where we would have to extend (likely just a couple extra custom fields) would be when we have to represent distinct variations of credentials. There are some cases where the same credential is offered in different ways within different business units.

### Academic Credit

- Academic credit is a unit of academic achievement that is approved by the accreditation body for the institution.

### Academic Calendar

- A schedule of Learning Opportunities across a Calendar. A Learning Opportunity is an offered Learning Experience including Instructors, location and times, video conference links, registration link, etc.

### Academic Catalog
